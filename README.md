# üå≥ Arbor Program

**On-chain router that escrows user margin, opens/maintains delta-neutral perp positions on Drift & Jupiter, and takes a single closing fee.**


Arbor is a Solana-native router that lets users open one-click, delta-neutral hedges: it escrows their USDC, goes long on one perp DEX and short on another, harvests the funding-rate spread, and charges a flat 1 % fee only when the position is closed‚Äîno custody, no price risk, fully on-chain.

## ‚ú®  Why Arbor?

* **Escrow-first design** ‚Äì Each order gets two PDA ‚Äúvaults‚Äù (one per DEX) so user funds never mingle.  
* **Flat 1 % closing fee** ‚Äì No management / performance skim; fee is moved to the **Treasury** only when the hedge is closed.  
* **Minimal surface** ‚Äì Seven core instructions, single `GlobalConfig`, single `Treasury` ATA.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Build & test
anchor test

# 2. Run devnet simulation (requires devnet RPC + airdrop)
cd simulate
yarn ts-node 1_initialize_environment.ts
yarn ts-node 2_create_order_trader.ts
...

# 3. Use the SDK
```
import { ArborClient } from '@arbor/sdk'
const arbor = await ArborClient.connect(devnetConnection, wallet)
await arbor.createOrder({ jupNotional: 5_000, driftNotional: 5_000, ... })
```
